Hello there, my name is Hampus. I have been programming for around 2 years and is currently experimenting with JavaScript and it's awesome features. I'm always trying to learn new languages.

```js
console.log('javahampus is a good guy');
```

```python
print('javahampus is a good guy')
```

```c
#include 
 
int main(void)
{
    puts('javahampus is a good guy');
}
```

```delphi
program javahampus;
begin
  Writeln('javahampus is a good guy');
end.
```
